Analyze ONLY the following URL string:
URL String: {data[url_string]}

Based *solely* on the structure and content of this URL string, identify any characteristics that might suggest it's a scam or malicious. Consider elements like:
- Typosquatting or impersonation of known brands (e.g., "go0gle.com", "paypal-secure.com-login.net").
- Use of excessive or misleading subdomains.
- Inclusion of suspicious keywords (e.g., "login," "update," "secure," "free," "prize") in unusual places.
- Use of IP addresses instead of domain names.
- Presence of Punycode that might hide internationalized domain name (IDN) homograph attacks.
- Length of the URL or path segments.
- Use of URL shorteners if discernible (though this data alone is not enough to judge).
- Unusual TLDs if apparent (though TLD risk is also assessed elsewhere).

Provide your assessment as a JSON object with "scam", "confidence", and "reason".
