# Discord Link Scanner Bot: Advanced AI-Powered URL Analysis

This Discord bot **leverages Artificial Intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs)**, to automatically scan messages for URLs and perform a deep, multi-faceted analysis to determine if they are malicious or part of a scam. Unlike traditional scanners that rely solely on blocklists or simple heuristics, this bot employs a **configurable pipeline of AI-driven assessment steps**. Each piece of information gathered about a URL (such as its string structure, DNS records, WHOIS data, SSL certificate validity, and even page content via headless Browse) can be individually assessed by an LLM. Finally, a **"Decider" LLM synthesizes all these AI-powered insights** to make a holistic judgment on the URL's safety.

If a link is flagged as suspicious by this comprehensive AI analysis, the bot takes configurable actions such as alerting moderators, notifying users, and assigning roles.

## Core Features

* **AI-Driven Analysis Pipeline:**
    * **Multi-Step LLM Assessment:** Analyzes URLs through a configurable sequence of steps. Each step gathers data (URL structure, reachability, DNS, WHOIS, SSL, optional page content via Playwright) and then uses a dedicated Large Language Model (LLM) with a tailored prompt to assess that specific aspect for scam indicators.
    * **"Final Decider" LLM:** After individual AI assessments, a final LLM synthesizes all findings to provide an overall scam classification (YES/NO) and confidence level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) for the URL.
    * **Configurable & Modular:** The analysis pipeline, including which steps are run, their data sources, and the LLM prompts used, is defined in an external YAML file (`urlanalysis/analysis_pipeline_config.yaml`). Prompts for each LLM interaction are stored in separate, easily editable text files.
* **Discord Integration:**
    * Monitors all messages in servers it's added to.
    * Detects URLs within message content.
    * **Adds Reactions:** Adds ‚úÖ (safe), üö® (suspicious), üíæ (cache hit), or ‚ö†Ô∏è (error) to messages based on the AI analysis outcome.
* **Alerting & Reporting:**
    * **Sends Detailed Alerts:** Posts an alert to a moderator channel for suspicious links, including the AI's reasoning and confidence.
    * **Attaches Full Analysis JSON:** If a link is deemed a scam by the AI, a comprehensive JSON report detailing all gathered data and individual AI step assessments is attached to the alert.
    * Notifies designated users via Direct Message.
* **User Actions:**
    * Assigns a specific role to users posting suspicious links.
    * Replies to the original message with a warning.
* **Performance & Scalability:**
    * Uses Redis for efficient caching of AI analysis results, reducing redundant processing.
    * Asynchronous operations for non-blocking performance.
* **Configuration:** Highly configurable via a `.env` file (for secrets and environment settings like API keys, Redis DSN) and the `analysis_pipeline_config.yaml` (for the AI analysis workflow).
* **Technology:** Built with Python, `discord.py`, `httpx` for LLM communication, Playwright for web interaction, and various network analysis libraries.

## How the AI Determines Suspicion

The bot's intelligence lies in its `url_analyzer.py` module and the configured AI pipeline:

1.  **Configuration Loading:** The `analysis_pipeline_config.yaml` file dictates the entire analysis flow. It specifies each step, what data to gather (e.g., DNS, WHOIS), and which prompt file to use for LLM assessment of that data.
2.  **Initial Checks:** A URL reachability check is performed early.
3.  **Sequential AI Assessment:** For each enabled step in the pipeline:
    * Relevant data is collected (e.g., SSL certificate details).
    * This data is formatted into a specific prompt (loaded from `urlanalysis/prompts/`).
    * An LLM (configured via `.env`) assesses this information and returns a structured JSON response indicating if *this specific aspect* appears scam-like, along with confidence and reasoning.
4.  **"Final Decider" LLM:** Once all individual AI assessment steps are complete, their outputs, along with the reachability status, are summarized and presented to a final "Decider" LLM. This LLM uses a master prompt to evaluate the totality of the evidence and make the ultimate call on whether the URL is a scam, providing an overall confidence level and a summary reason.
5.  **Action Trigger:** The Discord bot cog then uses this final AI judgment to take appropriate actions (reactions, alerts, etc.).

This layered AI approach allows for a nuanced and context-aware analysis, going beyond simple pattern matching.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* Access to a Discord server where you have permissions to add bots and manage roles/channels.
* A Discord Bot Token.
* **Access to an LLM API:** Configured to be compatible with OpenAI's API structure (e.g., Ollama with an appropriate model, OpenWebUI, or other commercial/private LLMs). This includes an API key/token and the correct API endpoint URL.
* **Redis Instance:** A running Redis server for caching analysis results.
* (Optional but Recommended) Docker and Docker Compose for containerized deployment.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository or download the files:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Or download and extract the ZIP
    cd discord-link-scanner-ai
    ```

2.  **Create and Configure `.env` file:**
    * Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
    * Fill in all required values:
        * `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
        * Discord Channel/Role/User IDs (`SUSPICIOUS_CHANNEL_ID`, `NOTIFY_USER_IDS`, `SUSPICIOUS_ROLE_ID`)
        * **LLM API Details:** `OPENWEBUI_TOKEN`, `OPENWEBUI_URL` (base URL, e.g., `http://localhost:11434`), `OPENWEBUI_LLM_MODEL` (e.g., `mistral:latest`).
        * **Redis Details:** `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_DB`, `REDIS_PASSWORD` (if any).

3.  **Configure the AI Analysis Pipeline:**
    * Review and customize `urlanalysis/analysis_pipeline_config.yaml` to define your desired analysis steps, enable/disable them, and set their corresponding prompt files.
    * Edit the prompt files in `urlanalysis/prompts/` to tailor the AI's behavior for each step and the final decision. **This is critical for accuracy.**

4.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Install Playwright browsers** (if any Playwright-dependent steps are enabled):
